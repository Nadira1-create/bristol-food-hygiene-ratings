## Business Case

### Problem statement
The current sources for viewing food hygiene ratings in Bristol are often outdated, difficult to navigate, or require downloading large datasets. Local food‑business owners receive inspection results that are published days or even weeks after the actual visit, creating a delay between when businesses make necessary improvements and when the public is informed. Members of the public often struggle to find easy‑to‑understand food hygiene ratings for restaurants and takeaways in Bristol. While the data exists in the Open Bristol datasets, it is not presented in a simple or accessible format, making it difficult for users to quickly check whether a food business is safe and hygienic. Many people are unaware of where to look for this information, which increases the risk of choosing unsafe establishments. High volume of unrated new businesses – Over 42 000 newly registered food premises have not yet received their first inspection, meaning a large segment of the market operates without any publicly available hygiene information. A modern, user‑friendly web application is needed to simplify access to food hygiene ratings, providing a seamless and accessible platform where the public can easily explore, view, and understand this important information, ensuring that everyone can make safer, more informed choices when dining out.

### Business benefits
1- User-Friendly Interface (The app offers an easy-to-navigate interface that makes it simple for users to search, filter, and view hygiene ratings,ensuring accessibility for all.)

Improved Public Health (This app aims to helps consumers make safer decisions when choosing where to eat, reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses.)

2- Competitive Advantage for Businesses (Food businesses with high hygiene ratings can use the platform as a marketing tool to attract health-conscious customers.

3- Encourages Hygiene Improvements (With ratings visible to the public, businesses are motivated to improve their hygiene standards to stay competitive. This encourages them to keep up with or surpass others in order to attract more customers who care about hygiene.)

4- User Engagement and Feedback (Allows consumers to report hygiene issues or provide feedback on their dining experiences, creating an interactive environment for accountability.)

5- Real-Time Data Access (The application ensures that users have immediate access to the latest food hygiene ratings)

6- Data Transparency ( The app provides full transparency by showing food hygiene ratings exactly as they are, with no changes or adjustments. This allows the public to view the ratings clearly and holds businesses accountable for their hygiene practices)

### Options Considered
1) Open data bristol   - Open data is available, but it’s in raw formats, which isn’t easy for users to understand.
2) Goverment websites  -  These sites have the data, but they’re hard to navigate and not mobile-friendly. Users most of the time can’t filter the results easily and may need to download large files or search through complex pages, making it tough to quickly find ratings.
3) third party reviews - These apps sometimes show hygiene ratings, but the ratings might not always be up-to-date, accurate or unclear.
4) create my own application - Building our own app gives us full control to design a simple straightforward user-friendly platform, that shows up-to-date hygiene ratings and makes it easy for people to find the info they need.


### Expected Risks
1) Privacy and Security Concerns
 If the app allows users to report hygiene issues or leave feedback, it’s essential to ensure both user and business information is kept confidential. Without proper security measures, there’s a risk of breach of data, which could lead to violations of privacy laws.
2) Maintenance and Scalability
The app may face challenges in scaling as the number of food premises grows. Continuous updates and maintenance may be needed to ensure the app remains reliable, especially as new hygiene inspection data is added regularly.
3) Incomplete Data / Data Accuracy
 There are thousands of new food businesses without hygiene ratings, so it may take time for the app to gather and display accurate information for all of them. This could result in incomplete data, which might frustrate users who expect to see ratings for every business. Also, since food hygiene ratings rely on inspections conducted by local authorities, there may be a delay in receiving and updating this data. Any inconsistency or delay of inspection results could affect the reliability of the app
